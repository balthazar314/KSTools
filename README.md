Some tools I'm working on to make it easyer to write Kerboscript programs for KOS (A kerbal Space Program mod)

Thanks to the [KSP-KOS](https://github.com/KSP-KOS) team for the great mod and to the developers of the [NDesk.Options library](http://www.ndesk.org/Options) for saving me a lot of time.


Sample output:
```
A simple out of game validator for the KerboScript Language
  -h, --help                 show the help message
  -f, --file=file            the kerboscript source file to validate
  -r, --rawCode="..."        raw kerboscript to be validated, must be in
                               parenthesizes "...", all internal parenthesies
                               must be escaped
```
